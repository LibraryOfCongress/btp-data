I. About this Dataset

This dataset is an export of transcriptions for 24,936 images from the Mary Church Terrell Papers created by volunteers participating in the Library of Congress crowdsourcing program By the People (https://crowd.loc.gov) campaign Mary Church Terrell: Advocate for African Americans and Women. It contains text created by volunteers through a transcription and review process, volunteer-created tags, digital collections metadata, and metadata representing the arrangement of the items in the By the People platform, Concordia.

By the People invites anyone to contribute to the Library of Congress as a virtual volunteer by transcribing and reviewing digital images of texts to enhance Library of Congress digital collections. Transcriptions are created and reviewed by volunteers in a consensus model that requires at least two volunteers to complete a transcription. Volunteer-created transcriptions are then published on the Library's website (https://www.loc.gov) alongside images of the original documents to improve search and discovery of digital collections and to improve accessibility of the text within the images. 

The dataset includes transcriptions and data generated from the pages in the By the People campaign Mary Church Terrell: Advocate for African Americans and Women https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/mary-church-terrell-advocate-for-african-americans-and-women/). The campaign consisted of all then available online images of digitized content from the Mary Church Terrell Papers (http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000076) transcribed in their entirety. The Terrell Papers reflect all phases of Terrell’s public career as an educator, lecturer, club woman, writer, and political campaigner. The collection contains diaries, correspondence, printed matter, clippings, and speeches and writings, primarily focusing on her advocacy for women's rights and equal treatment of African Americans. See the Mary Church Terrell Papers digital collection (http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000076) for all available online items for this collection, as well as contextual information, such as a timeline and bibliographic resources.

This .CSV is the direct export of the Mary Church Terrell: Advocate for African Americans and Women campaign.

Note: This dataset may contain UNICODE characters or lengthy transcriptions which may display incorrectly in some spreadsheet editors.


III. How Was It Created?

The transcriptions and tags were created by volunteers as part of the Library of Congress By the People program. By transcribing historical texts, virtual volunteers enhance Library of Congress digital collections. 

Transcriptions are created by anonymous and registered volunteers. Registered volunteers can review the transcriptions created by other volunteers. At least one volunteer must accept a transcription as whole and accurate before it is marked complete. A transcription may undergo multiple rounds of edits before being completed. Once completed, transcriptions are spot-checked by Library of Congress subject matter experts before they are incorporated into the digital collections on the Library's website to enhance search and accessibility.

Volunteers are instructed to transcribe the text as written, including misspellings and abbreviations. Formatting is generally not preserved with the exception of line breaks. Minimal markup does include “?” for illegible or unclear text, square brackets around deleted text, and square brackets and asterisks around marginalia ([*example*]). Pages without text are marked “nothing to transcribe” and do not have transcriptions in loc.gov.

Registered volunteers can tag images with text in any way they choose. Volunteers have used tags to highlight key terms or subjects from the text, identify the document format or language, expand abbreviated words, note correct spelling of misspelled words, and record contextual information about the document. Tags are not selected from a controlled vocabulary and may include variations of similar terms, misspellings, or other errors.

The Mary Church Terrell: Advocate for African Americans and Women data were created by 3,874 registered volunteers and an unknown number of anonymous volunteers. The Library of Congress thanks all By the People volunteers for sharing their time and knowledge with us. The Mary Church Terrell: Advocate for African Americans and Women campaign was fully transcribed and reviewed between October 24, 2018 and August 10, 2021.

Following the completion of the entire campaign via the peer review process and review by a subject matter expert, By the People Community Managers exported a CSV report from the campaign to create the file, mary-church-terrell-advocate-for-african-americans-and-women_2023-01-20.csv. 

The organization of the data and metadata included represents the arrangement of the items in the By the People platform, Concordia (https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia), an open source platform developed by the Library of Congress for crowdsourced transcription.


IV. Dataset Field Descriptions

This section lists and describes each of the fields included in the CSV file.

-	Campaign – this is the highest hierarchical level in the arrangement of collections on By the People (example: https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/mary-church-terrell-advocate-for-african-americans-and-women/). This field displays the campaign’s title.

-	Project – this is the second-highest hierarchical level of collections on By the People. Projects may map to an existing subset of a digital collection, such as an archival series, or may be a grouping of related items uniquely organized for By the People. This field displays the project’s title.

-	Item – this is the third-highest hierarchical level of collections on By the People, typically representing a folder, letter, document, or diary. This field displays the item title. 

-	ItemId – this is the identifier for the item (see above for definition). This numerical identifier is consistent across the By the People website and in loc.gov. The item and metadata are usually located on the Library’s website at https://www.loc.gov/item/[ItemID]/

-	Asset – this is the identifier for the individual asset image. It is also referred to colloquially as the “page” by By the People volunteers and Community Managers. This identifier is used in the By the People site and on loc.gov. 

-	AssetStatus – this indicates the status of the asset in the peer review workflow – Not Started, In Progress, Needs Review, or Completed. Dataset assets will always be marked as “Completed.” 

-	DownloadURL – this link provides access to the image file for the Asset from which the transcription was created.

-	Transcription – this is the text created by the By the People volunteers, representing the written content of the DownloadURL image and corresponding to the Asset. This field will be blank for assets that volunteers marked “Nothing to transcribe”.

-	Tags – these are all the tags that have been applied to the asset. If there is more than one tag, the tags are delimited by a semicolon and space.
